 * Daily purge of lesson audio older than the retention window.

 * audio is deleted after 30 days, which makes this route the thing that keeps
 * the promise true. If it stops running, we are misrepresenting what we do.
 *
 * Recordings are laid out as `{recordingId}/{track}.webm`, so the bucket root
 * lists as folders and the timestamps live one level down — hence the two-level
 * walk rather than a single flat listing.
 *
 * Everything in the folder goes, which now includes `transcript.json` — the
 * saved words a rebuild reuses instead of paying to hear the lesson again. That
 * file lives inside the recording's own folder precisely so it expires with the
 * audio, and this sweep needs no knowledge of it. The recap, the talk-time
 * figures and the lesson row are the teacher's record of the lesson and are
 * untouched.
