/**
 * A multipart POST that is allowed to take as long as it takes.
 *
 * WHY NOT fetch()
 * Node's global fetch is undici, and undici aborts a request whose response
 * headers have not arrived within 300 seconds. That limit is not configurable
 * through fetch's options, does not move when the platform's function timeout
 * is raised, and surfaces as a bare `TypeError: fetch failed` with nothing
 * naming the cause.
 *
 * It cost a real lesson. Transcribing a 52-minute track needs longer than five
 * minutes, so the send failed on Vercel's 300s function ceiling; raising the
 * plan to 800s moved that wall and the very next attempt died at 303 seconds
 * on this one instead.
 *
 * node:https has no such default — a request runs until the server answers or
 * the socket dies — so the only ceiling left is the platform's, which IS
 * configurable. There is no dependency to add: `undici` is not installed, and
 * pulling in a second copy of it to configure the first copy's dispatcher is a
 * well-known way to configure neither.

 * as inactive — Whisper sends nothing at all until the whole transcription is
 * ready. So this has to sit ABOVE the longest legitimate wait or it becomes
 * the very ceiling this module exists to remove. A first attempt at 120s
 * killed a transcription that was working perfectly.
 *
 * The default sits just under the platform's own function limit: long enough
 * never to fire on real work, short enough to release a genuinely dead socket
 * before the platform kills the whole invocation with no explanation.
