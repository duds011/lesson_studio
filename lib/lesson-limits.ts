/**
 * How long a lesson is allowed to be.
 *
 * Transcription is billed per minute of audio, and every lesson is recorded as
 * two tracks — mic and tab, each the full length of the call. One minute of
 * teaching is therefore two minutes on the invoice. A recorder left running
 * after everyone has said goodbye is not an untidy file, it is a bill that
 * grows on its own, and the teacher who forgot is the last person who would
 * ever notice.
 *
 * 55 minutes covers a scheduled hour with the goodbyes inside it. The Chrome
 * extension stops itself there; these limits exist because the version already
 * published to the Web Store does not, and because `seconds` arrives from a
 * client and is a claim rather than a measurement.

 * in at 10MB for 49 minutes). The allowance above that absorbs container
 * overhead and any drift in the encoder's actual rate, while still refusing the
